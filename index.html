<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>If you design, run, or analyze AB tests to drive business outcomes — whether in product, growth, or marketing — this paper is for you. It’s a warning about the hidden costs of using significance testing.</p>
<p>Significance testing, as typically applied in industry, is misaligned with how businesses actually create value. It was built for science — where false positives are catastrophic, and delays are acceptable. But in the business world, the opposite is often true: <strong>the real risk isn’t acting too soon — it’s waiting too long.</strong></p>
<p>This paper explores what happens when we let go of inherited defaults — like α = 0.05, 80% power, and fixed MDEs — and focus instead on decision quality. Using Bayesian inference and large-scale simulations, I’ll show how that shift leads to faster tests, more accurate decisions, and more profitable experimentation.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You run a test. The variant improves conversion by 0.7% (relative). It’s not statistically significant — so you kill it. What did you just leave on the table — and how many times has that happened before?</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="significance-testing" class="level1">
<h1>Significance Testing</h1>
<section id="misaligned-goals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="misaligned-goals">Misaligned Goals</h2>
<p><strong>Significance Testing</strong> is designed to rigorously control the frequency of false positives. If you’re writing physics papers or claiming groundbreaking scientific discoveries, it’s the perfect tool.</p>
<p>In these fields, false positives are extremely costly — both reputationally and scientifically. That’s why physicists often require 5-sigma evidence — about a 1 in 3.5 million chance that the result is a fluke.</p>
<p>But significance testing isn’t designed to answer the more important business question:</p>
<p>Which decision has the highest expected return — ending the test, running it longer, or taking action now?</p>
</section>
<section id="misaligned-costs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="misaligned-costs">Misaligned Costs</h2>
<p>Most companies default to a significance threshold of <strong>α = 0.05</strong> and statistical power of <strong>1 – β = 0.80</strong>. In practical terms, that means the test is designed to avoid <strong>false positives</strong> four times more aggressively than <strong>false negatives</strong>.</p>
<p>But in most business settings, <strong>false positives aren’t that costly</strong>. We thought a new button color improved conversion — turns out it didn’t. <strong>So what?</strong> The variant was flat, not disastrous.</p>
<p>But missing a true winner? That’s a lost opportunity — and sometimes, <strong>a costly one</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What if you throw away 20 experiments in a year each with p-values just above 0.05. How much could you be sacrificing?</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
</section>
<section id="bayesian-testing" class="level1">
<h1>Bayesian Testing</h1>
<section id="aligned-goals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aligned-goals">Aligned Goals</h2>
<p>The moment you ask, “What’s the expected value of this decision?”, you’ve entered Bayesian territory. You stop obsessing over p-values and start focusing on the projected impact of your actions.</p>
<p>Bayesian testing isn’t a new set of formulas — it’s a mindset shift. One that aligns probabilistic thinking with how businesses actually need to make decisions.</p>
</section>
<section id="aligned-costs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aligned-costs">Aligned Costs</h2>
<p>We use expected loss as our stopping criterion — a measure that quantifies the risk of making the wrong decision, combining both the likelihood of harm and its expected magnitude:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Expected Loss} = \Pr(\text{harm}) \times \mathbb{E}[\text{Magnitude of Harm}]
\]</span></p>
<p>Rather than ask, “Is this statistically significant?”, we ask, “What’s the cost of making the wrong call?” This cost is expressed in the same units as the metric itself — for conversion rate, in percentage points.</p>
<p>We’ll refer to expected loss as <code>Risk</code>, and we’ll search for the optimal level of Risk to bear for any given experiment design — seeking to balance caution with speed to maximize long-term value.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="a-simulation-framework" class="level1">
<h1>A Simulation Framework</h1>
<p>To evaluate these ideas under real-world constraints — limited time, finite traffic, and the tradeoff between speed and confidence — I simulate 50,000 randomized AB tests with equal allocation to control and treatment.</p>
<p>The key advantage of this framework is that we know the true effect behind each experiment, while the analysis methods (Bayesian and Significance) operate blindly, vulnerable to noise and randomness. Only after all decisions are made do we compare their outcomes — measuring accuracy, timing, and business value.</p>
<section id="experiment-design" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="experiment-design">Experiment Design</h2>
<p>Each of the 50,000 experiments runs for up to 20 days, with traffic split 50/50 between control and treatment. Users are randomly assigned daily, and outcomes are sampled using a binomial process — introducing natural variation that mimics how real experiments unfold over time.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Although the <strong>Control</strong> group has a true conversion rate of 65%, observed results will fluctuate due to random chance — just as they would in a real-world test.</p>
</section>
<section id="expected-effects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="expected-effects">Expected Effects</h2>
<p>Each experiment draws a treatment effect from a normal distribution centered at 100 with a standard error of 0.5 — modeling the natural variability seen in real-world tests, where small effects are common and large lifts are rare.</p>
<p>Even when a treatment is truly better (i.e., ITC &gt; 100), it can underperform in a given simulation due to random variation — just as it might in practice.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="candidate-risk-thresholds">Candidate Risk Thresholds</h2>
<p>A risk threshold defines how much expected loss we’re willing to tolerate before stopping the test and choosing a winner. To explore tradeoffs between speed and precision, we simulate decisions across a range of candidate thresholds — eg (from 0.01% to 0.10%). Lower thresholds are more conservative, delaying action until the risk is minimal. Higher thresholds allow faster decisions but accept more uncertainty.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>For each simulation, and each day after <code>Min (Test Days)</code>:
<ul>
<li>Compute <strong>Risk (expected loss)</strong> for both control and treatment conditions.</li>
<li>Compare each condition’s <strong>Risk</strong> to the candidate risk threshold.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decision rules:
<ul>
<li>If <strong>only one</strong> condition breaches the threshold → select it as the winner.</li>
<li>If <strong>both</strong> breach → choose the condition with the <strong>lower risk</strong>.</li>
<li>If <strong>neither</strong> breaches by the end of the test → select the condition with the <strong>lowest final risk</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>

- **Minimum test duration:** 7 days  
- **Current day:** 9  
- **Expected loss for Control:** 0.06 percentage points  
- **Expected loss for Treatment:** 0.02 percentage points  
- **Risk threshold:** 0.03 percentage points  


#### Decision Logic

- Treatment’s expected loss **falls below** the risk threshold → it's safe to stop and declare it the winner.

We stop the test **not because a p-value is below 0.05**, but because:

> “The cost of making the wrong decision is now acceptably low.”

This decision rule helps prioritize speed and safety without rigid statistical cutoffs.

<p>With Bayesian testing, I don’t get an arbitrary threshold — I get a curve. It maps projected year-end value across the test and post-test populations for each candidate risk threshold. This lets me see how different levels of risk tolerance actually perform — and choose the one that maximizes long-term business value.</p>

<p>Traditional significance tests — SPRT and Fixed — were built to detect big, obvious wins. But in these simulations, the average effect is 100. Small gains like 100.3? SPRT shrugs. Fixed tests, tuned to detect 101, never even notice.</p>
<p>These methods aren’t wrong — they’re just answering the wrong question. They optimize for avoiding false positives, not for capturing real value. As the comparison shows, Significance Tests routinely miss marginal winners and leaves potential gains on the table.</p>
<p><strong>Bayesian testing</strong>, on the other hand, isn’t concerned with p-values, power, or minimum detectable effects. It focuses on a single question: Is the risk low enough to act? That mindset proves far more profitable — across 50,000 simulations, Bayesian testing delivered <strong>2x the marginal value</strong> of Significance testing.</p>

# Glossary

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="" title="Significance Testing Glossary"}

### α (Alpha)
- **What it is**: The *significance level* — the probability of a **false positive** (Type I error).
- **Typical value**: `0.05` (or 5%)
- **In context**: If `α = 0.05`, there’s a 5% chance you’ll wrongly conclude a difference exists when it doesn’t.

---

### β (Beta)
- **What it is**: The probability of a **false negative** (Type II error).
- **Power = 1 – β**: A common target is `80%` power, meaning a `20%` chance of missing a true effect.
- **In context**: A high β means you risk overlooking a variant that’s actually better — lost upside.

---

### SPRT (Sequential Probability Ratio Test)
- **What it is**: A method that checks for significance **continuously** during the test.
- **Benefit**: Can stop experiments early if strong evidence accumulates.
- **In context**: Faster than fixed-duration tests, but may be overly conservative depending on thresholds.

---

### Mean Detectable Effect
- **What it is**: The *smallest effect size* you expect to detect reliably in your test.
- **In context**: If you set this to `1%`, your test is designed to detect changes that are at least that big — smaller changes might go unnoticed.

hypothesis testing/significance testing is predisposed to retain the null, even in the face of contrary evidence.
It's possible to make money even we average a Null effect!

<section id="counterargument" class="level1">
<h1>Counterargument</h1>
<p>Some might argue that this comparison was unfair — that we “stacked the deck” against significance testing by choosing α = 0.05, 80% power, and an MDE of 101.</p>
<p>But those aren’t cherry-picked values — they’re the defaults used across much of the tech industry. If those defaults lead to missed wins and underpowered tests, that’s not a critique of this simulation — it’s a critique of the status quo.</p>
<p>Others might say significance testing could perform better with a different combo of α, β, and MDE. But if you’re tuning those parameters to maximize business impact… You’re doing Bayesian inference — just with extra steps.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Significance testing has its place — but in business experimentation, it’s often too cautious for its own good. Designed to minimize false positives, it delays action even when the downside is minimal. Valuable wins are discarded in the name of statistical purity.</p>
<p>Bayesian testing takes a different path. It doesn’t demand overwhelming proof — just enough evidence to make a smart, low-risk decision. That mindset enables faster tests and more accurate decisions.</p>
<p>And this isn’t limited to conversion rates. The same approach works for continuous metrics like revenue, or for metrics you want to reduce — like churn, cancellations, or latency.</p>
<p>If you design, run, or analyze experiments, ask yourself: Is your testing framework helping you act — or holding you back?</p>
