<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Significance testing, as traditionally applied in AB experiments, is often misaligned with business goals. While these statistical methods aim to minimize false positives, real business impact is frequently driven by avoiding false negatives — missed opportunities to create value.</p>
<p>Below I show why significance thresholds like α = 0.05 are arbitrary and harm decision-making. I introduce Bayesian testing as a more practical alternative, and demonstrate through simulation how it better supports value-driven experimentation.</p>
<p>You’ll see that focusing on the expected value of our decisions is a far more profitable strategy than chasing statistical significance.</p>
</section>
<section id="significance-testing" class="level1">
<h1>Significance Testing</h1>
<section id="misaligned-goals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="misaligned-goals">Misaligned Goals</h2>
<p><strong>Significance Testing</strong> is designed to rigorously control the frequency of false positives. If you’re writing physics papers or claiming groundbreaking scientific discoveries, it’s the perfect tool.</p>
<p>In these fields, false positives are extremely costly — both reputationally and scientifically. That’s why physicists often require 5-sigma evidence — about a 1 in 3.5 million chance that the result is a fluke.</p>
<p>But significance testing isn’t designed to answer the more important business question:</p>
<p>Which decision has the highest expected return — ending the test, running it longer, or taking action now?</p>
</section>
<section id="misaligned-costs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="misaligned-costs">Misaligned Costs</h2>
<p>Most companies default to a significance threshold of <strong>α = 0.05</strong> and statistical power of <strong>1 – β = 0.80</strong>. In practical terms, that means the test is designed to avoid <strong>false positives</strong> four times more aggressively than <strong>false negatives</strong>.</p>
<p>But in most business settings, <strong>false positives aren’t that costly</strong>. We thought a new button color improved conversion — turns out it didn’t. <strong>So what?</strong> The variant was flat, not disastrous.</p>
<p>But missing a true winner? That’s a lost opportunity — and sometimes, <strong>a costly one</strong>.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="bayesian-testing" class="level1">
<h1>Bayesian Testing</h1>
<section id="aligned-goals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aligned-goals">Aligned Goals</h2>
<p>The moment you ask, “What’s the expected value of this decision?”, you’ve entered Bayesian territory. You stop obsessing over p-values and start focusing on the projected impact of your actions.</p>
<p>Bayesian testing isn’t a new set of formulas — it’s a mindset shift. One that aligns probabilistic thinking with how businesses actually need to make decisions.</p>
</section>
<section id="aligned-costs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aligned-costs">Aligned Costs</h2>
<p>We use expected loss as our stopping criterion — a measure that quantifies the risk of making the wrong decision, combining both the likelihood of harm and its expected magnitude:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Expected Loss} = \Pr(\text{harm}) \times \mathbb{E}[\text{Magnitude of Harm}]
\]</span></p>
<p>Rather than ask, “Is this statistically significant?”, we ask, “What’s the cost of making the wrong call?” This cost is expressed in the same units as the metric itself — for conversion rate, in percentage points.</p>
<p>We’ll refer to expected loss as <code>Risk</code>, and we’ll search for the optimal level of Risk to bear for any given experiment design — seeking to balance caution with speed to maximize long-term value.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="a-simulation-framework" class="level1">
<h1>A Simulation Framework</h1>
<p>To evaluate these ideas under real-world constraints — limited time, finite traffic, and the tradeoff between speed and confidence — I simulate 50,000 randomized AB tests with equal allocation to control and treatment.</p>
<p>The key advantage of this framework is that we know the true effect behind each experiment, while the analysis methods (Bayesian and Significance) operate blindly, vulnerable to noise and randomness. Only after all decisions are made do we compare their outcomes — measuring accuracy, timing, and business value.</p>
<section id="experiment-design" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="experiment-design">Experiment Design</h2>
<p>Each of the 50,000 experiments runs for up to 20 days, with traffic split 50/50 between control and treatment. Users are randomly assigned daily, and outcomes are sampled using a binomial process — introducing natural variation that mimics how real experiments unfold over time.</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 20%">
<col style="width: 21%">
<col style="width: 18%">
<col style="width: 18%">
<col style="width: 21%">

<tr class="header">
<th>Min (Test Days)</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>7</td>
<td>20</td>
<td>100,000</td>
<td>500,000</td>
<td>65%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Although the <strong>Control</strong> group has a true conversion rate of 65%, observed results will fluctuate due to random chance — just as they would in a real-world test.</p>
</section>
<section id="expected-effects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="expected-effects">Expected Effects</h2>
<p>Each experiment draws a treatment effect from a normal distribution centered at 100 with a standard error of 0.5 — modeling the natural variability seen in real-world tests, where small effects are common and large lifts are rare.</p>
<p>Even when a treatment is truly better (i.e., ITC &gt; 100), it can underperform in a given simulation due to random variation — just as it might in practice.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="candidate-risk-thresholds">Candidate Risk Thresholds</h2>
<p>A risk threshold defines how much expected loss we’re willing to tolerate before stopping the test and choosing a winner. To explore tradeoffs between speed and precision, we simulate decisions across a range of candidate thresholds — eg (from 0.01% to 0.10%). Lower thresholds are more conservative, delaying action until the risk is minimal. Higher thresholds allow faster decisions but accept more uncertainty.</p>

<li>For each simulation, and each day after <code>Min (Test Days)</code>:
<ul>
<li>Compute <strong>Risk (expected loss)</strong> for both control and treatment conditions.</li>
<li>Compare each condition’s <strong>Risk</strong> to the candidate risk threshold.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decision rules:
<ul>
<li>If <strong>only one</strong> condition breaches the threshold → select it as the winner.</li>
<li>If <strong>both</strong> breach → choose the condition with the <strong>lower risk</strong>.</li>
<li>If <strong>neither</strong> breaches by the end of the test → select the condition with the <strong>lowest final risk</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>

- **Minimum test duration:** 7 days  
- **Current day:** 9  
- **Expected loss for Control:** 0.06 percentage points  
- **Expected loss for Treatment:** 0.02 percentage points  
- **Risk threshold:** 0.03 percentage points  


#### Decision Logic

- Treatment’s expected loss **falls below** the risk threshold → it's safe to stop and declare it the winner.

We stop the test **not because a p-value is below 0.05**, but because:

> “The cost of making the wrong decision is now acceptably low.”

This decision rule helps prioritize speed and safety without rigid statistical cutoffs.

<p>With Bayesian testing, I don’t get an arbitrary threshold — I get a curve. It maps projected year-end value across the test and post-test populations for each candidate risk threshold. This lets me see how different levels of risk tolerance actually perform — and choose the one that maximizes long-term business value.</p>

<p>Let’s see how the same 50,000 simulations perform under traditional significance testing. We’ll use a standard setup: α = 0.05, 80% power, and a detectable effect of 101.</p>
<p>How does this legacy approach stack up against Bayesian testing in practice?</p>

<p>Significance-based methods — SPRT and Fixed — were built to detect big effects. But in our simulation, the average treatment effect is 100. That means most real-world gains fall below their detection threshold.</p>
<p><strong>SPRT</strong> is tuned to test MDE (101) vs.&nbsp;100. So when the effect is 100.3, it shrugs and moves on. <strong>Fixed</strong> tests are underpowered for anything below the MDE = 101, making them blind to most improvements.</p>
<p>The result is that <strong>Significance</strong> methods routinely miss marginal winners — and leave real value on the table. <strong>Bayesian Testing</strong> looks at risk and acts when the math says it’s safe.</p>
<p>Across 50,000 simulations, Bayesian testing delivered 2x the marginal value of significance testing.</p>

# Glossary

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="" title="Significance Testing Glossary"}

### α (Alpha)
- **What it is**: The *significance level* — the probability of a **false positive** (Type I error).
- **Typical value**: `0.05` (or 5%)
- **In context**: If `α = 0.05`, there’s a 5% chance you’ll wrongly conclude a difference exists when it doesn’t.

---

### β (Beta)
- **What it is**: The probability of a **false negative** (Type II error).
- **Power = 1 – β**: A common target is `80%` power, meaning a `20%` chance of missing a true effect.
- **In context**: A high β means you risk overlooking a variant that’s actually better — lost upside.

---

### SPRT (Sequential Probability Ratio Test)
- **What it is**: A method that checks for significance **continuously** during the test.
- **Benefit**: Can stop experiments early if strong evidence accumulates.
- **In context**: Faster than fixed-duration tests, but may be overly conservative depending on thresholds.

---

### Mean Detectable Effect
- **What it is**: The *smallest effect size* you expect to detect reliably in your test.
- **In context**: If you set this to `1%`, your test is designed to detect changes that are at least that big — smaller changes might go unnoticed.
