<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Significance testing, as traditionally applied in AB experiments, is often misaligned with business goals. While these statistical methods aim to minimize false positives, real business impact is frequently driven by avoiding false negatives — missed opportunities to create value.</p>
<p>Below I show why significance thresholds like α = 0.05 are arbitrary and distort decision-making. I introduce Bayesian testing as a more practical alternative, and demonstrate — through discussion and simulation — how it better supports value-driven experimentation.</p>
<p>By reframing AB testing around expected value and decision quality, I move beyond rigid thresholds toward practical impact — treating experimentation as an optimization problem, not just a statistical exercise.</p>
</section>
<section id="significance-testing" class="level1">
<h1>Significance Testing</h1>
<section id="misaligned-goals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="misaligned-goals">Misaligned Goals</h2>
<p><strong>Significance Testing</strong> is designed to rigorously control the frequency of false positives. If you’re writing physics papers or claiming groundbreaking scientific discoveries, it’s the perfect tool.</p>
<p>In these fields, false positives are extremely costly — both reputationally and scientifically. That’s why physicists often require 5-sigma evidence — about a 1 in 3.5 million chance that the result is a fluke.</p>
<p>But significance testing says nothing about the most important business questions:</p>
<p>Which decision has the highest expected return — ending the test, running it longer, or taking action now?</p>
</section>
<section id="misaligned-costs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="misaligned-costs">Misaligned Costs</h2>
<p>Most companies default to a significance threshold of <strong>α = 0.05</strong> and statistical power of <strong>1 – β = 0.80</strong>. In practical terms, that means the test is designed to avoid <strong>false positives</strong> four times more aggressively than <strong>false negatives</strong>.</p>
<p>But in most business settings, <strong>false positives aren’t that costly</strong>. We thought a new button color improved conversion — turns out it didn’t. <strong>So what?</strong> The variant was flat, not disastrous.</p>
<p>But missing a true winner? That’s a lost opportunity — and sometimes, <strong>a costly one</strong>.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="bayesian-testing" class="level1">
<h1>Bayesian Testing</h1>
<section id="aligned-goals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aligned-goals">Aligned Goals</h2>
<p>The moment you ask, “What’s the expected value of this decision?”, you’ve entered Bayesian territory. You stop obsessing over p-values and start focusing on the projected impact of your actions.</p>
<p>Bayesian testing isn’t a new set of formulas — it’s a philosophical shift. One that aligns probabilistic thinking with how businesses actually need to make decisions.</p>
</section>
<section id="aligned-costs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aligned-costs">Aligned Costs</h2>
<p>We abandon our obsession with p-values and statistical power by introducing the statistic <em>expected loss</em> as our stopping criterion.</p>
<p>Expected loss quantifies the risk of a bad decision as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Expected Loss} = \Pr(\text{harm}) \times \mathbb{E}[\text{Magnitude of Harm}]
\]</span></p>
<p>This simple formula captures two critical ideas: - The <strong>likelihood</strong> of a harmful outcome, - And its <strong>average cost</strong> when it occurs.</p>
<p>Instead of asking, “Is this result statistically significant?”, we ask, “What’s the cost of making the wrong call?” Expected loss is expressed in the same units as the underlying metric. For conversion rate, we will use <code>%</code>, which refers to <code>% pts</code>.</p>
<p>Going forward we refer to <em>expected loss</em> as <code>Risk</code>. We will use <code>Risk</code> to stop our experiments and seek to determine the optimal level of <code>Risk</code> to bear for any given experiment design.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="a-simulation-framework" class="level1">
<h1>A Simulation Framework</h1>
<p>To evaluate these principles under real-world constraints—limited time, limited traffic, and the tradeoff between speed and confidence—I will simulate 50,000 randomized AB tests with equal allocation to control and treatment groups.</p>
<p>The beauty of the framework is that we know the truth coded into the simulations, but the analysis methods are completely blind to the truth. Each method, Bayesian or Significance, will try their best. Only after they are done, we analyze their performance.</p>
<section id="experiment-design" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="experiment-design">Experiment Design</h2>
<p>Each of the 50,000 simulated experiments will span up to 20 days, with traffic split evenly between control and treatment groups. Each day, users are randomly assigned to a condition in a 50/50 ratio, and conversion outcomes are sampled using a binomial process. This introduces natural day-to-day variation, allowing the simulation to reflect how decisions evolve over time as new data accumulates.</p>

<tr class="header">

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>7</td>
<td>20</td>
<td>100,000</td>
<td>500,000</td>
<td>65%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Although the <strong>Control</strong> group has a true conversion rate of 65%, observed results will fluctuate due to random chance — just as they would in a real-world test.</p>
</section>
<section id="expected-effects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="expected-effects">Expected Effects</h2>
<p>Each of the 50,000 simulated experiments draws a random treatment effect from the distribution shown below — a normal distribution centered at 100 with a standard error of 0.5. This models the natural variability in real-world experiments, where most effects are small, large lifts are uncommon, and we never know the complete truth. Later we can consider swapping in other distributions like Laplce for fatter tails.</p>
<p>Just like the control group varies due to sampling, a treatment programmed to be better (ITC &gt; 100) may still underperform or overperform in any given simulation.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="candidate-risk-thresholds">Candidate Risk Thresholds</h2>
<p>A risk threshold defines how much expected loss I’m willing to tolerate before stopping the test and declaring a winner. To explore tradeoffs between speed and accuracy, I simulate decisions using a range of candidate thresholds (e.g., 0.01%, 0.02%, …, 0.10%).</p>
<p>Each candidate represents a different level of risk tolerance: lower thresholds are more cautious, while higher ones allow for faster decisions with greater uncertainty.</p>

<li>For each simulation, and each day after <code>min(test_days)</code>:
<ul>
<li>Compute <strong>Risk (expected loss)</strong> for both control and treatment conditions.</li>
<li>Compare each condition’s <strong>Risk</strong> to the candidate risk threshold.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decision rules:
<ul>
<li>If <strong>only one</strong> condition breaches the threshold → select it as the winner.</li>
<li>If <strong>both</strong> breach → choose the condition with the <strong>lower risk</strong>.</li>
<li>If <strong>neither</strong> breaches by the end of the test → select the condition with the <strong>lowest final risk</strong>.</li>

- **Minimum test duration:** 7 days  
- **Current day:** 9  
- **Expected loss for Control:** 0.06 percentage points  
- **Expected loss for Treatment:** 0.02 percentage points  
- **Risk threshold:** 0.03 percentage points  


#### Decision Logic

- Treatment’s expected loss **falls below** the risk threshold → it's safe to stop and declare it the winner.

We stop the test **not because a p-value is below 0.05**, but because:

> “The cost of making the wrong decision is now acceptably low.”

This decision rule helps prioritize speed and safety without rigid statistical cutoffs.

<p>With Bayesian testing, I don’t get an arbitrary threshold — I get a curve. It maps projected year-end value across the test and post-test populations for each candidate risk threshold. This lets me see how different levels of risk tolerance actually perform — and choose the one that maximizes long-term business value.</p>
