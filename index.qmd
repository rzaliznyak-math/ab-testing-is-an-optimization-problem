# Introduction

I first heard about "AB Testing" way back in 2008 when I joined the tech world. My bachelor's degree from San Jose State in Mathematics exposed me to hypothesis testing. So p-values, statistical power, and confidence intervals were all familiar concepts to me. 

Over the years I built many iterations of experiment design and analysis tools. And used the CLT to expand tools to support continuous metrics like revenue and time-on-site. Later I discovered that the Sequential Probability Ratio Test could help me to run faster experiments. I wrote simulations to estimate SPRT runtime in our design tools.

I built tools to design and analyze sequential significance experiments. I became a relative expert on controlling the frequency of Type I errors (false positives) and Type II errors (false negatives). 


But so what? Are these frequentist methods generating value for the company? Or is it an exercise in pedantry?
Within a few short paragraphs, you'll see why significance testing in industry is a massive failure.
